## CAML
===============

A good start to learn fonctionnal languages is ocaml or caml, that means Categorical Abstract Machine Language), 

It's a simple language and very near mathematics that was create by Inria, an object implementation was added to it since 1996.

We found ocaml in many domains due to it simplicity and it power. 

Let's pop in an exemple with a simple editor [ocaml online](https://try.ocamlpro.com/)

I love take the Fibonacci sequence. 

| U0 = 1
| u1 = 1
| Un+2 = Un+1 + Un

let's crack it :

    let rec fibo n = mathc n with  (* with do not have for or while loop ;) *)
        0 -> 0 (* first case of stop is if n is egal to 0 *)
      | 1 -> 1 
      | n -> (fibo(n-1)) + (fibo(n-2));; (* here we call back the funciton*)

And here is all the beauty we do not need to know how it's work if it's work for the next step.

## Ocaml
An ocaml exemple

For documents like check, where digits need to be written in full words and in number in ocaml we can implements a simple converter like this one :

    let full_words = 
      let digit = [|"zero"; "one"; "two"; "three"; "foor"; "five"; "six"; "seven"; "eight"; "nine" |] in
      let rec words w n = 
        if n = 0 then (
          match w with 
              [] -> [digit.(0) 
            | _ -> w
           )
        else words (digit.(n mod 10) :: w) (n / 10) in
        fun n -> String.concat "-" (words [] n);;
